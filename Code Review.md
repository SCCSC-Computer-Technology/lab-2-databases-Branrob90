Code Review – Brandon Roberts (By Michael Lee)

Your code is well-written and easy to understand. Could maybe use some more comments, but not a big deal with a program like this one. Only real problem I noticed was that there seems to be an issue with pressing the “add” button in the top BindingNavigator. Other than that, everything works and works well. It looks like we took a lot of the same approaches as well. Great job!
